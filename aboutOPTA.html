<p>OPTA (Operationalized Theory of Action) BETA is a powerful, open-source web-based application designed for non-

profit organizations in the education sector that pursue overarching goals through partnerships with multiple service

providers, each with its own goals and strategies. OPTA will provide funders and intermediary organizations and their

partners with a structured framework for articulating individual and collective goals and associated strategies, identifying

aligned indicators of success, and using the results to paint a richly diagnostic picture of the efficacy of the organization

and each partner at short intervals.</p>
                        
                        
<h3>What is an Operationalized Theory of Action?</h3>
					

<p>A Theory of Action describes the relationship between an organization’s actions and the outcomes it hopes to achieve. It

communicates an organization’s primary objective—its <em>raison d’être</em>—and the strategy it expects to follow to fulfill that

objective.</p> 

<p>Designing an effective Theory of Action requires two simple yet critical steps:</p> 

  <p class="setOff"><strong>Step One:</strong> Articulate a clear and measurable objective.
  <br><strong>Step Two:</strong> State the actions that, together, will achieve that objective.</p> 

<p>State the actions that, together, will achieve that objective.</p> 

<div class="diagram_toa toaformula"><div class="stepBox"><em><strong>If</strong></em> we do “X Action”…</div>
<div class="stepBtw">+</div>
<div class="stepBox">… and “Y Action” …</div>
<div class="stepBtw">=</div>
<div class="stepBox">… <em><strong>then</strong></em> we will achieve “Z Objective.”</div></div>


<p>OPTA uses an evaluative framework to help translate your Theory of Action into a set of concrete steps that can help you implement the Theory of Action and track your progress in doing so. An evaluative framework reveals the connection (or lack of it) between an organization’s actions and its goals and helps define indicators of progress in moving from actions (or the “if” statements in your Theory of Action), to the result or outcome (or the “then” statements).</p> 

<p>As used in OPTA, the evaluative framework also helps you (i) articulate the rationale behind your particular Theory of Action and (ii) identify what is logically necessary to realize your strategy. </p>



<p><h3><em>How does OPTA Work?</em></h3></p>

    <div class="panel panel-info">
      <div class="panel-heading"><span>4</span> Impact </div>
    </div>
           
</div>

<p>The following is a brief description of the Evaluative Framework components:</p>

<div class="panel panel-info">
    <div class="panel-heading"><span>1</span> Inputs</div>
</div>
                      
                      <p>Inputs are the resources necessary to implement Actions, or the preconditions for your work. Inputs include financial information, such as the amount of funding, and may also include your organization’s and external parties’ commitments of time and personnel. For example, an organization may require salaries for five full-time staff members. You may also need to identify Inputs expected from districts, school leaders and staff, and other third parties that are necessary for the full and effective implementation of all Actions, such as weekly meetings with school principals or classroom space. Attributing an Input to an external party signifies that you have made the necessary arrangements with the other party to assure that Inputs are provided.</p>

    <div class="panel panel-info">
      <div class="panel-heading"><span>2</span> Actions </div>
    </div>

<p>Actions are tangible work or activities necessary to achieve desired outcomes. In addition to articulating Actions, you must also select indicators that measure the implementation of those Actions. For example, an Action may be training principals to be instructional leaders. Implementation of this Action may be measured by tracking the number of principal classroom observations, and the average time spent providing feedback to teachers. If necessary, Actions may need to be attributed to districts, school leaders and staff, and other third parties in order to achieve desired outcomes. Attributing an Action to an external party signifies that you have made the necessary arrangements with the other party to assure that the Actions occur.</p>

    <div class="panel panel-info">
      <div class="panel-heading"><span>3</span> Outcomes </div>
    </div>

<p>Outcomes are the expected short- and mid-term effects of the Actions. In addition to defining Outcomes, you must also select indicators to measure whether the Outcomes are materializing as planned. These Outcomes may be leading indicators, such as measuring the effectiveness of training principals to be instructional leaders by surveying teachers about the quality of observations and feedback sessions. They also may be lagging indicators, such as measuring the effectiveness of tutoring sessions and workshops designed for the lowest-performing students by calculating the gap in test scores between the highest and lowest performing students.</p>

<p>Indicators tracking Actions and indicators tracking Outcomes differ in the following respect. Action indicators measure whether an Action is implemented, (for example, counting the number of feedback sessions), but do not speak to the quality of a given Action. Outcome metrics assess the effectiveness of an Action. This enables you and your partner organization to differentiate between Actions that are ostensibly ineffective simply because they are not occurring and Actions that are actually ineffective. In such a case, the Actions are undertaken, but they simply do not lead to the expected Outcome.</p>

    <div class="panel panel-info">
      <div class="panel-heading"><span>4</span> Impact </div>
    </div>

<p>Impact is the long-term result of initiatives across a portfolio of funded initiatives. By engaging with your organization, your organizing partner (usually a funder) has made the judgment that your organizational objectives, or Outcomes, sufficiently link to their Impact.</p>

<p>Your Theory of Action should link your organization’s work with these Impact measures. For  example, although providing breakfast to students in the morning may not directly have an effect on test scores, a Theory of Action can demonstrate how ensuring that students are nourished in the morning will influence their ability to pay attention in class, to retain information and learn, and thus to raise their scores.  Conversely, your work may be focused entirely on raising student achievement, thus overlapping your desired Outcomes with your organizing partner’s Impact.</p> 

<p><h3><em>What is the value of this evaluative framework?</em></h3></p>

<p>One value of the evaluative framework is to diagnose weaknesses, hidden assumptions, or missing steps in a Theory of Action based on collected data. Although the “theory” driving the Theory of Action may draw upon well-established social science and research or hard-won practical experience, it may lack precision and accuracy in a given setting. The Theory of Action may be incomplete due to failure to identify hidden assumptions—often about what external stakeholders must do for an organization’s Actions to mature into Impacts. The evaluative framework in OPTA is designed as a logic model to test, as well as implement, the Theory of Action under a particular set of circumstances.</p> 

<p>In order to have a Theory of Action that effectively links Inputs to Impact, each step along the evaluative framework must be <em>logically connected to</em> the following step. In other words, the Inputs should include <em>all</em> of the logically necessary resources for executing the Actions; the Actions—by <em>themselves</em> and without other unstated activities—can be reasonably expected to produce the Outcomes; and the Outcomes are reasonably expected to lead to the Impact. Identification of the critical elements in a Theory of Action enables an organization to test whether there are gaps in the contemplated chain of activities.</p>

<p>The evaluative framework helps diagnose mistaken assumptions about a link between a specified action and its intended result; such assumptions must be made explicit for the strategy to be successful. For example, a stated Action may be to conduct professional development sessions, and the success—or, the desired Outcome—of these sessions may require a particular level of teacher participation. If so, and assuming that teacher participation is the responsibility of the relevant school or district, not the organization itself, this condition or Input must be explicitly stated. Otherwise, if the desired Outcome does not materialize from these professional development sessions, though the organization seems to have fulfilled all of the Actions it specified in the logic model, both the organization and Public Square will find it difficult to diagnose and resolve the problem.</p>
