<p><h3><em>What is an effective Theory of Action?</em></h3></p>

<blockquote><p>Each “Initiative” you create in OPTA will be driven by an effective Theory of Action. Your Theory of Action describes the impact that should run through all the measures you choose t track.</p>

<p><strong>An effective Theory of Action…</strong></p>

<p class="setOff"><strong>… relatively stable but subject to modification.</strong> An organization’s Theory of Action will rarely change drastically over time, but an effective Theory of Action statement should invite multiple, iterative modifications. As a Theory of Action is implemented and data points are collected, the Theory of Action statement should be updated, as relevant, to reflect lessons learned. For example, an organization may at first silently assume a necessary precondition to the effective operation of its actions or a supplemental link between those actions and the intended outcome. Alternatively, that organization may silently expect certain prerequisites to be put in place by someone else. When the absence of that action or link contributes to the failure of the organization’s actions to generate their intended effect, the organization will realize that its Theory of Action—and the practical steps it or others must take—will have to change in order to supply the missing prerequisite. Through this iterative process of change, the Theory of Action gains precision and accuracy, and the organization is better able to implement and evaluate strategies.
</p>

<p class="setOff"><strong>… includes measurable actions and objectives.</strong> The Theory of Action should be premised on actions and objectives that can be measured in a meaningful way. Even if the most accurate and valid metrics may not be available, using strong proxies can help an organization evaluate and track progress along their Theory of Action.</p>

<p class="setOff"><strong>… contemplates both leading and lagging indicators of success.</strong> Often, an organization’s program and services are offered in pursuit of meaningful long-term impact that takes time to actualize. A Theory of Action should therefore contemplate some leading indicators that are reasonably strong predictors of the desired long-term impact. Conversely, if an organization’s program and services are focused almost entirely on producing short-term results, it is critical to consider the long-term implications of such results.</p>

<p class="setOff"><strong>… demonstrates a causal relationship between actions and objectives, as well as leading and lagging indicators of success.</strong> The Theory of Action statement should present what at first is a theory of a causal relationship between actions and outcomes. An organization’s goals and objectives should be logically connected to, and causally linked to, the organization’s primary activities and actions. The iterative process of change described above reflects the organization’s acquisition of knowledge about how its causal theory lines up with—and can be changed to line up better with—actual practice.</p></blockquote>

                        
<p><h3><em>Hard, quantitative data do not always reflect our progress. <br />How do we communicate all that we accomplish?</em></h3></p>
						

<blockquote><p>OPTA captures qualitative data, as well. <br />Your qualitative feedback on your activities, 

progress towards goals, and real-life interactions with partners will bring contextual, 

more nuanced light to your initiative. This information can be included in the various 

areas in OPTA.</p></blockquote> 

 

<p><h3><em>We pursue the same Outcomes and engage in the same Actions for all of our initiatives. <br />Can we report our results at an aggregate level?</em></h3></p>

<blockquote><p>Not precisely. OPTA captures initiative-specific measures because often the work that 

succeeds at one organization may encounter challenges at another. It is important for 

the organizing partner to have information from each partner they work with so progress 

may be tracked on a case-by-case basis.</p> 

<p>However, organizing partners may use identical metrics for multiple initiatives. It is 

possible to copy the completed metrics in the required fields into the identical fields for 

the additional initiatives you work in.</p></blockquote>

<p><h3><em>What if our desired Outcomes will not actualize within the time frame?</em></h3></p>

<blockquote><p>OPTA is designed to capture both short-term and long-term progress. It is understood 

that sustainable change will take time to achieve. Immediate and drastic progress within 

a limited time frame is not necessarily expected, but appropriate Actions and related 

metrics should be captured by OPTA to demonstrate interim progress.</p> 

<p>In addition, strong leading indicators will demonstrate to your organizing partner that 

your programs and Theory of Action have been implemented well. Where available, 

qualitative data, including surveys and quality reviews, should also help to explain and 

support slow progress.</p></blockquote>

<p><h3><em>How do funders measure and track the Impact of its portfolio of initiatives?</em></h3></p>

<blockquote><p>Funders translate the aggregate actions of its diverse portfolio into indicators of ultimate Impact though an OPTA heat map, which is a composite of multiple indicators of performance.</p></blockquote>
